# Astronomy

This sometimes gets grouped with Physics, but I have not wanted to make another repository yet.

"Ground Control Saves Major Time

The Mars 3 landing remained mostly obscure to anyone but space-exploration devotees until a little over a decade ago.

But in 2007, U.S. researchers shared an image from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and unleashed a years-long scramble to find the silenced Soviet lander.

They titled it "Center of Soviet Mars 3 Landing Ellipse" to challenge the public to help scour the image's 1.8 billion pixels of data for Mars 3 or its wreckage."

"The purpose of Stallion, based at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), is the visualization of large scientific datasets. In a recent write-up Jo Wozniak, a visualization specialist working on Stallion, explained that the higher resolution and greater brightness will allow boffins to pick out details that otherwise would have been missed without the larger scale.

For instance, one of the first applications of the updated array was by the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS), which used Stallion to visualize data collected by the James Webb Space Telescope. Another application is for high-resolution rendering of models."

The Stallion could be usedful in identifying wreckage on Mars and the Moon for human eyes, but nowadays, that is likely augmented by automated AI. Nonetheless, as the saying goes, "Everything in Texas is bigger."


Cepheid variables

"Astronomers have used the James Webb and Hubble space telescopes to confirm one of the most troubling conundrums in all of physics â€” that the universe appears to be expanding at bafflingly different speeds depending on where we look."

"The second method uses pulsating stars called Cepheid variables. Cepheid stars are dying, and their outer layers of helium gas grow and shrink as they absorb and release the star's radiation, making them periodically flicker like distant signal lamps.

As Cepheids get brighter, they pulsate more slowly, giving astronomers a means to measure their absolute brightness. By comparing this brightness to their observed brightness, astronomers can chain Cepheids into a "cosmic distance ladder" to peer ever deeper into the universe's past. With this ladder in place, astronomers can find a precise number for its expansion from how the Cepheids' light has been stretched out, or red-shifted.

But this is where the mystery begins. According to Cepheid variable measurements taken by Riess and his colleagues, the universe's expansion rate is around 74 km/s/Mpc: an impossibly high value when compared to Planck's measurements. Cosmology had been hurled into uncharted territory."
